# BFS and DFS Visualization Project

## Overview
I worked on this project to understand and visualize two fundamental graph traversal algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. The goal was to implement these algorithms in Python and create visualizations to demonstrate how they explore nodes in a graph. This project helped me gain a deeper understanding of graph theory, algorithm design, and visualization techniques using Python libraries like `networkx` and `matplotlib`.

## Project Description
The project consists of the following components:
1. **BFS Implementation**: A Python function to perform Breadth-First Search on a graph, exploring nodes level by level.
2. **DFS Implementation**: A Python function to perform Depth-First Search on a graph, exploring nodes as deeply as possible before backtracking.
3. **Graph Generation**: A function to generate a connected random graph using the `networkx` library.
4. **Visualization**: A function to visualize the traversal process step-by-step, highlighting the current node being explored in red.

## Key Features
- **BFS and DFS Algorithms**: Implemented from scratch using Python.
- **Random Graph Generation**: Ensures the graph is connected and suitable for traversal.
- **Step-by-Step Visualization**: Demonstrates the order in which nodes are visited during BFS and DFS.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Uses `matplotlib` to create an animated visualization of the traversal process.

## Libraries Used
- `networkx`: For graph creation and manipulation.
- `matplotlib`: For visualizing the graph and traversal process.
- `queue`: For implementing the BFS queue.
